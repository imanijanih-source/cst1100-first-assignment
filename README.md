# CST1100 - First Assignment

## Introduction
Hi! My name is Imani Williams. I am taking CST1100 because I want to strengthen my computer science foundation and gain experience using tools like GitHub that professionals use.

One fun fact about me is that I enjoy cooking new recipes from online, traveling, running, music, dancing. 

Iâ€™m excited to learn new skills in this class and start building projects I can be proud of.
